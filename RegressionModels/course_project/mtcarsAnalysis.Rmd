In this analysis, we aim to examine the fuel consumption of 1973–74 model automobiles as it relates to different aspects of automobile design and performance. The main factor around which we will categorize the analysis will be the type of transmission, automatic or manual. Dependency on the remaining design aspects will be further evaluated to look to quantify the differences observed, if any, in fuel consumption between transmission types.
